# NetworksAndNetworkingProjects
Projects that deal with network and networking from my class

## What's included:
There are two assigments that are included: singlyLinkedList.c and slidingWindowSelectiveRepeat.py . They are assignments that went through basic things needed when talking about networks and networking.

There are also four tutorial files included in which I walked through different tutorials on how to create a client and server network: ClientMedium.py, EchoClientTutorial.py, EchoServerTutorial.py, and ServerMedium.py .

The final project for the class is also included. It was a group project and I was specifically in charge of making the design of the app and fixing all the errors after my groupmates initialized the client and server files. It is linked to the repository and has a README.
